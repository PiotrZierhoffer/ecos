>In a typical development environment the M5272C3 board boots from
flash into the RedBoot ROM monitor. eCos applications are configured
for a RAM startup, and then downloaded and run on the board via the
debugger m68k-elf-gdb. Preparing the board therefore involves
programming a suitable RedBoot image into flash memory.

>Initial Installation</H2
><P
>This process assumes that the board still has its original dBUG ROM
monitor and does not require any special debug hardware. It leaves the
existing ROM monitor in place, allowing the setup process to be
repeated just in case that should ever prove necessary.
    </P
><P
>Programming the RedBoot rom monitor into flash memory requires an
application that can manage flash blocks. RedBoot itself has this
capability. Rather than have a separate application that is used only
for flash management during the initial installation, a special
RAM-resident version of RedBoot is loaded into memory and run. This
version can then be used to load the normal flash-resident version of
RedBoot and program it into the flash.
    </P
><P
>The first step is to connect an RS232 cable between the M5272C3
terminal port and the host PC. A suitable cable is supplied with the
board. Next start a terminal emulation application such as
HyperTerminal or minicom on the host PC and set the serial
communication parameters to 19200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop
bit (8N1) and no flow control (handshaking). Make sure that the jumper
next to the flash chip is set for bootstrap from the bottom of flash,
location 0xFFE00000. The details of this jumper depend on the revision
of the board, so the supplied board documentation should be consulted
for more details. Apply power to the board and you should see a
<SAMP

correct. If there is no suitable BOOTP service running on the local
network then BOOTP should be disabled, and instead RedBoot will prompt
for a fixed IP address, netmask, and addresses for the local gateway
and DNS server. The other exception is the network hardware address,
also known as MAC address. All boards should be given a unique MAC
address, not the one in the above example. If there are two boards on
the same network trying to use the same MAC address then the resulting
behaviour is undefined.
