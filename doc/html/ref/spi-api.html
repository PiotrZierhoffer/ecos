>Description</H2
><P
>All SPI functions take a pointer to a
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_spi_device</CODE
> structure as their first
argument. This is an opaque data structure, usually provided by the
platform HAL. It contains the information needed by the SPI bus driver
to interact with the device, for example the required clock rate and
polarity.
    </P
><P
>An SPI transfer involves the following stages:
    </P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Perform thread-level locking on the bus. Only one thread at a time is
allowed to access an SPI bus. This eliminates the need to worry about
locking at the bus driver level. If a platform involves multiple SPI
buses then each one will have its own lock. Prepare the bus for
transfers to the specified device, for example by making sure it will
tick at the right clock rate.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Assert the chip select on the specified device, then transfer data to
and from the device. There may be a single data transfer or a
sequence. It may or may not be necessary to keep the chip select
asserted throughout a sequence.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Optionally generate some number of clock ticks without asserting a
chip select, for those devices which need this to complete an
operation.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Return the bus to a quiescent state. Then unlock the bus, allowing
other threads to perform SPI operations on devices attached to this
bus.
      </P
></LI
></OL
><P
>The simple functions <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transfer</CODE
> and
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_tick</CODE
> perform all these steps in a single
call. These are suitable for simple I/O operations. The alternative
transaction-oriented functions each perform just one of these steps.
This makes it possible to perform multiple transfers while only
locking and unlocking the bus once, as required for more complicated
devices.
    </P
><P
>With the exception of
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transaction_begin_nb</CODE
> all the functions
will block until completion. There are no error conditions. An SPI
transfer will always take a predictable amount of time, depending on
the transfer size and the clock rate. The SPI bus does not receive any
feedback from a device about possible errors, instead those have to be
handled by software at a higher level. If a thread cannot afford the
time it will take to perform a complete large transfer then a number
of smaller transfers can be used instead.
    </P
><P
>SPI operations should always be performed at thread-level or during
system initialization, and not inside an ISR or DSR. This greatly
simplifies locking. Also a typical ISR or DSR should not perform a
blocking operation such as an SPI transfer.
    </P
><P
>SPI transfers can happen in either polled or interrupt-driven mode.
Typically polled mode should be used during system initialization,
before the scheduler has been started and interrupts have been
enabled. Polled mode should also be used in single-threaded
applications such as RedBoot. A typical multi-threaded application
should normally use interrupt-driven mode because this allows for more
efficient use of cpu cycles. Polled mode may be used in a
multi-threaded application but this is generally undesirable: the cpu
will spin while waiting for a transfer to complete, wasting cycles;
also the current thread may get preempted or timesliced, making the
timing of an SPI transfer much less predictable. On some hardware
interrupt-driven mode is impossible or would be very inefficient. In
such cases the bus drivers will only support polled mode and will
ignore the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>polled</CODE
> argument.

aligned to a cache-line boundary, even for SPI devices which use DMA
transfers, but some bus drivers may provide better performance if the
buffer is suitably aligned. The buffer will not be modified by the

<CODE

complicated devices. This provides separate functions for each of the
steps in an SPI transfer.
    </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transaction_begin</CODE
> must be used at the
start of a transaction. This performs thread-level locking on the bus,
blocking if it is currently in use by another thread. Then it prepares
the bus for transfers to the specified device, for example by making
sure it will tick at the right clock rate.
    </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transaction_begin_nb</CODE
> is a non-blocking
variant, useful for threads which cannot afford to block for an
indefinite period. If the bus is currently locked the function returns
false immediately. If the bus is not locked then it acts as
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg_spi_transaction_begin</TT
> and returns true.
    </P
><P
>Once the bus has been locked it is possible to perform one or more
data transfers by calling
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transaction_transfer</CODE
>. This takes the same
arguments as <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transfer</CODE
>, plus an additional
one <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>drop_cs</CODE
>. A non-zero value specifies that
the device's chip select should be dropped at the end of the transfer,
otherwise the chip select remains asserted. It is essential that the
chip select be dropped in the final transfer of a transaction. If the
protocol makes this difficult then
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transaction_tick</CODE
> can be used to generate
dummy ticks with all chip selects dropped.
    </P
><P
>If the device requires additional clock ticks in the middle of a
transaction without being selected,
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transaction_tick</CODE
> can be used. This will
drop the device's chip select if necessary, then generate the
appropriate number of ticks. The arguments are the same as for
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_tick</CODE
>.
    </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_spi_transaction_end</CODE
> should be called at the
end of a transaction. It returns the SPI bus to a quiescent state,
then unlocks it so that other threads can perform I/O.
    </P
><P
>A typical transaction might involve the following. First a command
should be sent to the device, consisting of four bytes. The device
will then respond with a single status byte, zero for failure,
non-zero for success. If successful then the device can accept another
n bytes of data, and will generate a 2-byte response including a
checksum. The device's chip select should remain asserted throughout.
The code for this would look something like:

>If an SPI bus driver does not support the exact clock rate specified
it will normally use the nearest valid one. SPI bus drivers may define
additional keys appropriate for specific hardware. This means that the
valid keys are not known by the generic code, and theoretically it is
possible to use a key that is not valid for the SPI bus to which the
device is attached. It is also possible that the argument used with
one of these keys is invalid. Hence both
