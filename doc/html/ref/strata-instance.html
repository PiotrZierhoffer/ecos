><P
>Each of these comes in a range of sizes and bus widths. There are also
platform-specific issues such as how many devices are actually present
on the board and where they are mapped in the address space. The
Strata driver package cannot know all this information. Instead it
is the responsibility of another package, usually the platform HAL, to
instantiate some flash device structures. Two pieces of information
are especially important: the bus configuration and the boot block
layout.
    </P
><P
>Flash devices are typically 8-bits, 16-bits, or 32-bits wide (64-bit
devices are not yet in common use). Most 16-bit devices will also
support 8-bit accesses, but not all. Similarly 32-bit devices can be
accessed 16-bits at a time or 8-bits at a time. A board will have one
or more of these devices on the bus. For example there may be a single
16-bit device on a 16-bit bus, or two 16-bit devices on a 32-bit bus.
The processor's bus logic determines which combinations are possible,
and usually there will be a trade off between cost and performance.
For example two 16-bit devices in parallel can provide twice the
memory bandwidth of a single device. The driver supports the following
combinations:

>The second piece of information is the boot block layout. Flash
devices are subdivided into blocks (also known as sectors, both terms
are in common use). Some operations such as erase work on a whole
block at a time, and for most applications a block is the smallest
unit that gets updated. A typical block size is 64K. It is inefficient
to use an entire 64K block for small bits of configuration data and
similar information, so some flash devices also support a number of
smaller boot blocks. A typical 2MB flash device could have eight 8K
blocks and 31 full-size 64K blocks. The boot blocks may appear at the
bottom or the top of the device. So-called uniform devices do not have
boot blocks, just full-size ones. The driver needs to know the boot
block layout. With modern devices it can work this out at run-time,
but often it is better to provide the information statically.

>Flash support is usually specific to each platform. Even if two
platforms happen to use the same flash device there are likely to be
differences such as the location in the address map. Hence there is
little possibility of re-using the platform-specific code, and this
code is generally placed in the platform HAL rather than in a separate
package. Typically this involves a separate file and a corresponding
compile property in the platform HAL's CDL:

access the flash device. The main disadvantage of using CFI is that it
will increase the code size.

flash may have been set to read-only, in an attempt to catch spurious
memory accesses. Erasing or programming the flash requires
write-access, so the MMU settings have to be changed temporarily. For
another example some flash device may require a higher voltage to be
applied during an erase or program operation. or a higher voltage may
be desirable to make the operation proceed faster. A typical

erase and program operations both involve polling for completion, and
these timeout impose an upper bound on the polling loop. Normally
these operations should never take anywhere close to the timeout
period, and hence a timeout probably indicates a catastrophic failure
that should really be handled by a watchdog reset. A reset is
particularly appropriate because there will be no clean way of
aborting the flash operation. The main reason for the timeouts is to
help with debugging when porting to new hardware. If there is a valid
reason why a particular platform needs different timeouts then the
platform HAL's CDL can require appropriate values for these options.

there could be one bank of 2 parallel flash devices at 0xFF800000 and
another bank at 0xFFC00000, giving a total of 8MB. This setup can be
described in several ways. One approach is to define two
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

function pointers can usually be shared, as can the

table, covering the blocks in both banks of devices. The second
approach makes more efficient use of memory.

<CODE

needed, e.g. to save the current interrupt state;
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>BEGIN</CODE
> disables interrupts, synchronizes the data
caches, disables it, and invalidates the current contents;
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>END</CODE
> re-enables the cache and then
interrupts. The cache is only disabled when interrupts are disabled,
so there is no possibility of an interrupt handler running or a
context switch occurring while the cache is disabled, potentially
leaving the system running very slowly. The data cache synchronization
ensures that there are no dirty cache lines, so when the cache is
disabled the low-level flash write code will not see stale data in
memory. The invalidate ensures that at the end of the operation
higher-level code will not pick up stale cache contents instead of the
newly written flash data.

semantics required by the flash driver. For example
<CODE

effect, or it may do more work than is needed here. The driver will
check for alternative macros

<CODE
