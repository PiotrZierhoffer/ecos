>In this version of the code, when <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>res_allocate</CODE
>
detects that there are no resources it calls
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_wait</CODE
>. This does two things: it unlocks
the mutex, and puts the calling thread to sleep on the condition
variable. When <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>res_free</CODE
> is eventually called, it
puts a resource back into the pool and calls
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_signal</CODE
> to wake up any thread waiting on
the condition variable. When the waiting thread eventually gets to run again,
it will re-lock the mutex before returning from
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_wait</CODE
>.
      </P
><P
>There are two important things to note about the way in which this
code works. The first is that the mutex unlock and wait in
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_wait</CODE
> are atomic: no other thread can run
between the unlock and the wait. If this were not the case then a call
to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>res_free</CODE
> by that thread would release the
resource but the call to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_signal</CODE
> would be
lost, and the first thread would end up waiting when there were
resources available.
      </P
><P
>The second feature is that the call to
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_wait</CODE
> is in a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>while</TT
>
loop and not a simple <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>if</TT
> statement. This is because
of the need to re-lock the mutex in <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_wait</CODE
>
when the signalled thread reawakens. If there are other threads
already queued to claim the lock then this thread must wait. Depending
on the scheduler and the queue order, many other threads may have
entered the critical section before this one gets to run. So the
condition that it was waiting for may have been rendered false. Using
a loop around all condition variable wait operations is the only way
to guarantee that the condition being waited for is still true after
waiting.
      </P
><P
>Before a condition variable can be used it must be initialized with a
call to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_init</CODE
>. This requires two
arguments, memory for the data structure and a pointer to an existing
mutex. This mutex will not be initialized by
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_init</CODE
>, instead a separate call to
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_init</CODE
> is required. If a condition
variable is no longer required and there are no threads waiting on it
then <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_destroy</CODE
> can be used.
      </P
><P
>When a thread needs to wait for a condition to be satisfied it can
call <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_wait</CODE
>. The thread must have already
locked the mutex that was specified in the
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_init</CODE
> call. This mutex will be unlocked
and the current thread will be suspended in an atomic operation. When
some other thread performs a signal or broadcast operation the current
thread will be woken up and automatically reclaim ownership of the mutex
again, allowing it to examine global state and determine whether or
not the condition is now satisfied.
      </P
><P
>The kernel supplies a variant of this function,
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_timed_wait</CODE
>, which can be used to wait on
the condition variable or until some number of clock ticks have
occurred. The number of ticks is specified as an absolute, not
relative tick count, and so in order to wait for a relative number of
ticks, the return value of the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_current_time()</CODE
>
function should be added to determine the absolute number of ticks.
The mutex will always be reclaimed before
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_timed_wait</CODE
> returns, regardless of
whether it was a result of a signal operation or a timeout.
      </P
><P
>There is no <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_trywait</CODE
> function because
this would not serve any purpose. If a thread has locked the mutex and
determined that the condition is satisfied, it can just release the
mutex and return. There is no need to perform any operation on the
condition variable.
      </P
><P
>When a thread changes shared state that may affect some other thread
blocked on a condition variable, it should call either
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_signal</CODE
> or
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_cond_broadcast</CODE
>. These calls do not require
ownership of the mutex, but usually the mutex will have been claimed
before updating the shared state. A signal operation only wakes up the
first thread that is waiting on the condition variable, while a
broadcast wakes up all the threads. If there are no threads waiting on
the condition variable at the time, then the signal or broadcast will
have no effect: past signals are not counted up or remembered in any
way. Typically a signal should be used when all threads will check the
same condition and at most one thread can continue running. A
broadcast should be used if threads check slightly different
conditions, or if the change to the global state might allow multiple
threads to proceed.
