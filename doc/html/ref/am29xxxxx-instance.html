>Description</H2
><P
>The AM29xxxxx family contains some hundreds of different flash
devices, all supporting the same basic set of operations but with
various common or uncommon extensions. The devices vary in capacity,
performance, boot block layout, and width. There are also
platform-specific issues such as how many devices are actually present
on the board and where they are mapped in the address space. The
AM29xxxxx driver package cannot know the details of every chip and
every platform. Instead it is the responsibility of another package,
usually the platform HAL, to supply the necessary information by
instantiating some data structures. Two pieces of information are
especially important: the bus configuration and the boot block layout.
    </P
><P
>Flash devices are typically 8-bits, 16-bits, or 32-bits wide (64-bit
devices are not yet in common use). Most 16-bit devices will also
support 8-bit accesses, but not all. Similarly 32-bit devices can be
accessed 16-bits at a time or 8-bits at a time. A board will have one
or more of these devices on the bus. For example there may be a single
16-bit device on a 16-bit bus, or two 16-bit devices on a 32-bit bus.
The processor's bus logic determines which combinations are possible,
and there will be a trade off between cost and performance: two 16-bit
devices in parallel can provide twice the memory bandwidth of a single
device. The driver supports the following combinations:

for each configuration, for example

><P
>The second piece of information is the boot block layout. Flash
devices are subdivided into blocks (also known as sectors - both terms
are in common use). Some operations such as erase work on a whole
block at a time, and for most applications a block is the smallest
unit that gets updated. A typical block size is 64K. It is inefficient
to use an entire 64K block for small bits of configuration data and
similar information, so many flash devices also support a number of
smaller boot blocks. A typical 2MB flash device could have a single
16K block, followed by two 8K blocks, then a 32K block, and finally 31
full-size 64K blocks. The boot blocks may appear at the bottom or the
top of the device. So-called uniform devices do not have boot blocks,
just full-size ones. The driver needs to know the boot block layout.
With modern devices it can work this out at run-time, but often it is
better to provide the information statically.

>In most cases flash support is specific to a platform. Even if two
platforms happen to use the same flash device there are likely to be
differences such as the location in the address map. Hence there is
little possibility of re-using the platform-specific code, and this
code should be placed in the platform HAL rather than in a separate
package. Typically this involves a separate file and a corresponding
compile property in the platform HAL's CDL:

It can be used if the <CODE

>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</CODE

<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_flash_dev</CODE
> structures are fully
initialized statically and the flash will just work without special
effort. This is useful if it is guaranteed that the board will always
be manufactured using the same flash chip, since the nop function
involves the smallest code size and run-time overheads.
      </P

>The next step up is
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_check_devid_XX</CODE
>, where
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>XX</TT
> will be replaced by the suffix appropriate for
the bus configuration. It is still necessary to provide all the device
information statically, including the <CODE
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>devid</CODE
>
field in the <CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</CODE
> structure.
This initialization function will attempt to query the flash device
and check that the provided device id matches the actual hardware. If
there is a mismatch the device will be marked uninitialized and
subsequent attempts to manipulate the flash will fail.
      </P
><P
>If the board may end up being manufactured with any of a number of
different flash chips then the driver can perform run-time
initialization, using a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_cfi_XX</CODE
>
function. This queries the flash device as per the Common Flash Memory
Interface Specification, supported by all current devices (although
not necessarily by older devices). The
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>block_info</CODE
> field in the
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</CODE
> structure and the
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"

> and
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>num_block_infos</CODE
> fields in the
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_flash_dev</CODE
> structure will be filled in.
It is still necessary to supply the <CODE
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>start</CODE
>
field statically since otherwise the driver will not know how to
access the flash device. The main disadvantage of using CFI is that it
increases the code size.

before and after the erase and program operations. For example if the
hardware has an MMU then the part of the address map containing the
flash may have been set to read-only, in an attempt to catch spurious
memory accesses. Erasing or programming the flash requires
write-access, so the MMU settings have to be changed temporarily. As
another example some flash device may require a higher voltage to be
applied during an erase or program operation. or a higher voltage may
be desirable to make the operation proceed faster. A typical
platform-specific erase function would look like this:

The erase and program operations both involve polling for completion,
and these timeout impose an upper bound on the polling loop. Normally
these operations should never take anywhere close to the timeout
period, so a timeout indicates a catastrophic failure that should
really be handled by a watchdog reset. A reset is particularly
appropriate because there will be no clean way of aborting the flash
operation. The main reason for the timeouts is to help with debugging
when porting to new hardware. If there is a valid reason why a
particular platform needs different timeouts then the platform HAL's
CDL can require appropriate values for these options.

>Multiple Devices</H2

>A board may have several flash devices in parallel, for example two
16-bit devices on a 32-bit bus. It may also have several such banks
to increase the total amount of flash. If each device provides 2MB,
there could be one bank of 2 parallel flash devices at 0xFF800000 and
another bank at 0xFFC00000, giving a total of 8MB. This setup can be
described in several ways. One approach is to define two
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_flash_dev</CODE
> structures. The table of
function pointers can usually be shared, as can the
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</CODE

is to define a single <CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_flash_dev</CODE

structure but with a larger <CODE

table, covering the blocks in both banks of devices. The second
approach makes more efficient use of memory.

<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>STATE</CODE

needed, e.g. to save the current interrupt state;
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>BEGIN</CODE
> disables interrupts, synchronizes the data
caches, disables it, and invalidates the current contents;
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>END</CODE
> re-enables the cache and then
interrupts. The cache is only disabled when interrupts are disabled,
so there is no possibility of an interrupt handler running or a
context switch occurring while the cache is disabled, potentially
leaving the system running very slowly. The data cache synchronization
ensures that there are no dirty cache lines, so when the cache is
disabled the low-level flash write code will not see stale data in
memory. The invalidate ensures that at the end of the operation
higher-level code will not pick up stale cache contents instead of the
newly written flash data.

semantics required by the flash driver. For example
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_DCACHE_DISABLE</CODE

effect, or it may do more work than is needed here. The driver will
check for alternative macros

<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_AM29XXXXX_INTSCACHE_BEGIN</CODE
