>There are three levels of synchronization supported:</P

><OL

><LI

>    Synchronization with ISRs. This normally means disabling
    interrupts to prevent the ISR running during a critical
    section. In an SMP environment, this will also require the use of
    a spinlock to synchronize with ISRs, DSRs or threads running on
    other CPUs.  This is implemented by the
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_isr_lock()</CODE
> and
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_isr_unlock()</CODE
> functions. This
    mechanism should be used sparingly and for short periods only.
    For finer grained synchronization, individual spinlocks are also
    supplied.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Synchronization with DSRs. This will be implemented in the kernel
    by taking the scheduler lock to prevent DSRs running during
    critical sections. In non-kernel configurations it will be
    implemented by non-kernel code. This is implemented by the
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_dsr_lock()</CODE
> and
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_dsr_unlock()</CODE
> functions. As with ISR
    synchronization, this mechanism should be used sparingly. Only
    DSRs and threads may use this synchronization mechanism, ISRs are
    not allowed to do this.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Synchronization with threads. This is implemented with mutexes
    and condition variables. Only threads may lock the mutexes and
    wait on the condition variables, although DSRs may signal
    condition variables.
    </P

><P
>Any data that is accessed from more than one level must be protected
against concurrent access. Data that is accessed by ISRs must be
protected with the ISR lock, or a spinlock at all times,
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>even in ISRs</I
></SPAN
>. Data that is shared between DSRs
and threads should be protected with the DSR lock. Data that is only
accessed by threads must be protected with mutexes.</P
