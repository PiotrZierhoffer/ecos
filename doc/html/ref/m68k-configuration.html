>By default the architectural HAL provides a single block of memory to
act as both the startup stack and the interrupt stack. The variant,
processor or platform HAL may override this. For example if there are
several banks of RAM with different performance characteristics it may
be desirable to place the interrupt stack in fast RAM rather than in
ordinary RAM.
    </P

>The assembler startup code sets the stack pointer to the startup stack
before switching to C code. This stack used for all HAL
initialization, running any C++ static constructors defined either by
eCos or by the application, and the <CODE

>cyg_start</CODE
>
entry point. In configurations containing the eCos kernel
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_start</CODE

scheduler and threads will then run on their own stacks. In non-kernel
single-threaded applications the whole system continues to run on the
startup stack.
    </P

>When an interrupt occurs the default behaviour is to switch to a
separate interrupt stack. This behaviour is controlled by the common
HAL configuration option
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGIMP_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_USE_INTERRUPT_STACK</CODE
>.
It reduces the stack requirements of all threads in the system, at the
cost of some extra instructions during interrupt handling. In kernel
configurations the startup stack is no longer used once the scheduler
starts running so its memory can be reused for the interrupt stack. To
handle the possibility of nested interrupts the interrupt handling
code will detect if it is already on the interrupt stack, so in
non-kernel configurations it is also safe to use the same area of
memory for both startup and interrupt stacks. This leads to the
following scenarios:

startup and interrupt stacks. The size of this block is determined by
the common HAL configuration option

>Floating Point Support</H2
><P
>There are many variants of the basic M68K architecture. Some of these
have hardware floating point support. Originally this came in the form
of a separate 68881 coprocessor, but with modern variants it will be
part of the main processor chip. If the processor does not have
hardware floating point then software emulation will be used instead.
    </P
><P
>If the processor on the target hardware has a floating point unit then
the variant or processor HAL will implement the CDL interface
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGINT_HAL_M68K_VARIANT_FPU</CODE
>. This allows the
architectural HAL and other packages to do the right thing on
different hardware.
    </P
><P
>Saving and restoring hardware floating point context increases
interrupt and dispatch latency, code size, and data size. If the
application does not actually use floating point then these overheads
are unnecessary, and can be suppressed by disabling the configuration
option <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGIMP_HAL_M68K_FPU_SAVE</CODE
>. Some applications
do use floating point but only in one thread. In that scenario it is
also unnecessary to save the floating point context during interrupts
and context switches, so the configuration option can be disabled.
    </P
><P
>The exact behaviour of the hardware floating point unit is determined
by the floating point control register <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>%fpcr</CODE
>. By
default this is initialized to 0, giving IEE754 standard behaviour,
but another initial value can be specified using the configuration
option <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_HAL_M68K_FPU_CR_DEFAULT</CODE
>. For details
of the various bits in this control register see appropriate hardware
documentation. eCos assumes that the control register does not change
on a per-thread basis and hence the register is not saved or restored
during interrupt handling or a context switch.

The M68K architectural HAL package does not define any other
configuration options that can be manipulated by the user. It does
define a number of interfaces such as
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGINT_HAL_M68K_USE_STANDARD_PLATFORM_STUB_SUPPORT</CODE
>
which can be used by lower levels of the M68K HAL hierarchy to enable
certain functionality within the architectural package. Usually these
are of no interest to application developers.
