>The web server allows writing of pseudo-CGI programs. This is helpful in order
to modify the functionality of the server without having to recompile it and
reflash it.</P
><P
>One way to implement CGI is, of course, the C language callback mechanism
described above: This assumes, of course, that all the callbacks are written
by compile time and cannot be modified later on. Another way to perform the
same functionality is the use of a library in the form of an object file. 
These object files reside in the file system and are loaded, executed and 
unloaded on demand.</P
><P
>Yet a third way is the use of a scripting language. Since full fledged
implementation of the most popular scripting languages such as Python or Perl
are too large for most embedded systems, a slim down implementation of tcl
was chosen for this server. Most of the tcl functionality is still there,
and makes writing cgi a lot easier.</P
><P
>In order to limit the footprint of the operating system support for both
the objloader and the tcl script for dealing with cgi files can be 
independently selected out. Tcl support in particular increases the memory
requirements considerably.</P

NAME="ATHTTPD-CGI-OBJLOADER"
>CGI via objloader</A
></H2
><P
>In order to use the cgi mechanism the CYGPKG_OBJLOADER must be included
when building the operating system. This will enable the proper option in the
configuration tool and if selected, the necessary code will be compiled
in the eCos kernel. The user will then have to compile the necessary libraries
and place them in the file system under a directory defined by 
CYGDAT_NET_ATHTTPD_SERVEROPT_CGIDIR.
When a request is made, the web server checks if the root directory of the 
requested URL is inside the CYGDAT_NET_ATHTTPD_SERVEROPT_CGIDIR directory.
If so, the server assumes that the user requested a cgi file and looks into the
directory to see if a library by the same name is present, and if so load it
and tries to execute a function inside the library with the following prototype:</P

>The pointer <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CYG_HTTPD_STATE*</B
> gives access to the socket 
data: The user will use this pointer to access the 'outbuffer' and use it to
copy data to send data out.</P
><P
>When using the OBJLOADER package within the HTTP server a number of functions 
are automatically added to the externals table of the OBJLOADER package. These
functions are likely to be used inside the library and the relocator need to 
have a pointer to them. In order to add more functions, see the OBJLOADER
documentation. The complete list of the functions automatically added is:</P

>Every time the web client issues a GET or POST request for a file with an 
extension of '.o'in the /cgi-bin directory (or whatever path the user chooses 
to hold the libraries) then the library by that name is loaded, run and
when the execution is over, it is dumped from memory.

The library must be compiled separately, using the same toolchain used to 
compile the server and then added to the file system.</P
><P
>In order to reduce the footprint of the server, CGI through OBJLOADER
can be compiled out by unchecking CYGOPT_NET_ATHTTPD_USE_CGIBIN_OBJLOADER
in the configuration tool.</P

>A small tcl interpreter has been added to the web server, and it can
be used to write simple cgi scripts. The interpreter is admittedly very
minimal, and it is only useful for very simple applications, but it is an
excellent starting point for further development.</P
><P
>In order for the scripting language to be useful, it has to access
the form variables passed on during the GET or POST request. Because of
this, all form variables registered with the CYG_HTTPD_FVAR_TABLE_ENTRY()
macro are accessible via tcl. For example, if we have registered a
form variable called foo, and during the GET request we are defining foo
as being "1":</P

in the body of a POST request is also accessible through the use of the variable
$post_data. This is useful if the data is not in "multipart/form-data"
and tcl has to perform any type of processing on the data itself.</P

added to the interpreter. These functions are:</P
