><H2
>Description</H2
><P
>All members of the Freescale MCFxxxx ColdFire family of processors
contain a number of on-chip UARTs for serial communication. They all
use very similar hardware. There are some variations such as different
fifo sizes, and some processors contain extra functionality such as
autobaud detection, but a single eCos device driver can cope with most
of these differences. The
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_DEVS_SERIAL_MCFxxxx</CODE
> package provides this
driver. It will use definitions provided by the variant HAL
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx</CODE
>, the processor HAL and the
platform HAL.
    </P
><P
>The driver provides partial support for hardware flow control and for
serial line status. Only CTS/RTS hardware flow control is supported
since the UART does not provide DTR/DSR lines. Similarly only line
breaks, and certain communication errors are supported for line status
since the UART does not provide other lines such as DCD or RI. On some
platforms it should be possible to emulate these lines using GPIO
pins, but currently there is no support for this.
    </P
><P
>Once application code accesses a UART through the serial driver, for
example by opening a device <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ser0</TT
>, the driver
assumes that it has sole access to the hardware. This means that the
UART should not be used for any other purpose, for example HAL
diagnostics or gdb debug traffic. Instead such traffic has to go via
another communication channel such as ethernet.

><H2
>Configuration Options</H2
><P
>    The MCFxxxx serial driver should be loaded automatically when
selecting a platform containing a suitable processor, and it should
never be necessary to load it explicitly. The driver as a whole is
inactive unless the generic serial support,
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_DEVICES</CODE
>, is enabled. Exactly which
UART or UARTs are accessible on a given platform is determined by the
platform because even if the processor contains a UART the platform
may not provide a connector. Support for a given UART, say uart0, is
controlled by a configuration option
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_DEVS_SERIAL_MCFxxxx_SERIAL0</CODE
>. The device
driver configuration option in turn depends on a HAL configuration
option <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART0</CODE
> to indicate
that the UART is actually present and connected on the target
hardware. If a given UART is of no interest to an application
developer then it is possible to save some memory by disabling this
option.
    </P
><P
>For every enabled UART there are a further four configuration options:

><P
>Each serial device should have a unique name so that application code
can open it. The default device names are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ser0</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/ser1</TT
>, and so on. It is only necessary to change
these if the platform contains additional off-chip UARTs with clashing
names.

><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_DEVS_SERIAL_MCFxxxx_SERIAL0_ISR_PRIORITY</CODE
></DT
><DD
><P
>By default the driver arranges for the UARTs to interrupt at a low
interrupt priority. Usually there will be no need to change this
because the driver does not actually do very much processing at ISR
level, and anyway UARTs are not especially fast devices so do not
require immediate attention. On some Coldfires with MCF5282-compatible
interrupt controllers care has to be taken that all interrupt
priorities are unique.

><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_DEVS_SERIAL_MCFxxxx_SERIAL0_BAUD</CODE
></DT
><DD
><P
>Each UART will be initialized to a given baud rate. The default baud
rate is 38400 because in most scenarios this is fast enough yet
does not suffer from excess data corruption. Lower baud rates can be
used if the application will operate in an electrically noisy
environment, or higher baud rates up to 230400 can be used if
38400 does not provide sufficient throughput.

></DD
><DT
><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_DEVS_SERIAL_MCFxxxx_SERIAL0_BUFSIZE</CODE
></DT
><DD
><P
>The serial driver will maintain software buffers for incoming and
outgoing data. The former allows data to continue to arrive even if
the application is still busy processing the previous transfer, and
thus potentially improves throughput. The latter allows the
application to transmit data without immediately blocking until the
transfer is complete, often eliminating the need for a separate
thread. The size of these buffers can be controlled via this
configuration option, or alternatively these buffers can be disabled
completely to save memory.
        </P

><P
>There are additional options in the generic serial I/O package
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL</CODE
> which will affect this driver. For
example <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_FLOW_CONTROL</CODE
> and its
sub-options determine what flow control mechanism (if any) should be
used.
    </P
><P
>This package also defines some configuration options related to
testing. Usually these options are of no interest to application
developers and can be ignored.

>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART1</CODE

<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"

calculated or user-configurable depending on the processor.

>The device driver will also look for symbol definitions
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART0_RTS</CODE

<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART0_CTS</CODE
>, and the
equivalents for the other UARTs, to determine whether or not these
handshake lines are connected. These may be configuration options or
they may be statically defined in a HAL I/O header file. The platform
HAL should also implement the generic serial package's interface
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGINT_IO_SERIAL_FLOW_CONTROL_HW</CODE
> if appropriate.

><P
>If RTS is connected then the driver will also look for a symbol
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART0_RS485_RTS</CODE
>. This
enables partial support for RS485 communication in that the device
driver will arrange for the RTS line to be asserted during a transmit.
The driver has no support for more advanced RS485 functionality such
as multidrop.
      </P
></LI
></OL
><P
>In addition the driver assumes the standard MCFxxxx HAL macros are
defined for the UART base addresses and the registers. The driver
primarily targets MCF5282-compatible UARTs but there is also some
support for functionality available on other members of the Coldfire
range, for example the MCF5272's fractional baud rate support.
