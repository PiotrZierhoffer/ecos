should be provided for every device on the bus. Usually this is the
responsibility of the platform HAL. In the case of development boards
where the I2C SDA and SCL lines are accessible via an expansion
connector, more devices may have been added and it will be the
application's responsibility to provide the structures. Finally
there is a need for one or more <CODE

structures. Amongst other things these structures provide functions
for actually driving the bus. If the processor has dedicated I2C
hardware then this structure will usually be provided by a device
driver package. If the bus is implemented by bit-banging then the bus
structure will usually be provided by the platform HAL.

exporting the structures directly can be problematical because of
circular dependencies between the I2C header and the HAL headers.

>There is no single convention for naming the I2C devices. If the
device will be used by some other package then typically that
specifies the name that should be used. For example the DS1307
wallclock driver expects the I2C device to be called
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>cyg_i2c_wallclock_ds1307</CODE
>, so failing to observe
that convention will lead to compile-time and link-time errors. If the
device will not be used by any other package then it is up to the
platform HAL to select the name, and as long as reasonable care is
taken to avoid name space pollution the exact name does not matter.

>Some processors come with dedicated I2C hardware. On other hardware
the I2C bus involves simply connecting some GPIO pins to the SCL and
SDA lines and then using software to implement the I2C protocol. This
is usually referred to as bit-banging the bus. The generic I2C package
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_IO_I2C</CODE
> provides the main code for a
bit-banged implementation, requiring one platform-specific function
that does the actual GPIO pin manipulation. This function is usually
hardware-specific because different boards will use different pins for
the I2C bus, so typically it is left to the platform HAL to provide
this function and instantiate the I2C bus object. There is no point in
creating a separate package for this because the code cannot be
re-used for other platforms.

do the actual bit-banging. It takes two arguments. The first
identifies the bus, which can be useful if the hardware has multiple
I2C buses. The second specifies the bit-bang operation that should be
performed. To understand these operations consider how I2C devices
should be wired up according to the specification:

>Master and slave devices are interfaced to the bus in exactly the same
way. The default state of the bus is to have both lines high via the
pull-up resistors. Any device on the bus can lower either line, when
allowed to do so by the protocol. Usually the SDA line only changes
while SCL is low, but the start and stop conditions involve SDA
changing while SCL is high. All devices have the ability to both read
and write both lines. In reality not all bit-banged hardware works
quite like this. Instead just two GPIO pins are used, and these are
switched between input and output mode as required.

high, indicating that the data on the SDA line is stable. However
there is a complication: if a device is not ready yet then it can
throttle back the master by keeping the SCL line low. This is known as
clock-stretching. Hence for this operation the bitbang function should
allow the SCL line to float high, then poll it until it really has
become high. If a single pin is used for the SCL line then this pin
should be turned back into a high output at the end of the call.

single pin is used to handle both input and output of SDA, to avoid
a situation where both the master and the slave are driving the SDA
line for an extended period of time. The operation combines dropping
the SCL line and switching SDA to an input in an atomic or near-atomic
operation.

>Depending on the hardware some care may have to be taken when
manipulating the GPIO pins. Although the I2C subsystem performs the
required locking at the bus level, the device registers controlling
the GPIO pins may get used by other subsystems or by the application.
It is the responsibility of the bitbang function to perform
appropriate locking, whether via a mutex or by briefly disabling
interrupts around the register accesses.
