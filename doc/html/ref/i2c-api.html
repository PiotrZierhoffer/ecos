><P
>All I2C functions take a pointer to a
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_i2c_device</CODE
> structure as their first
argument. These structures are usually provided by the platform HAL.
They contain the information needed by the I2C bus driver to interact
with the device, for example the device address.
    </P
><P
>An I2C transaction involves the following stages:
    </P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Perform thread-level locking on the bus. Only one thread at a time is
allowed to access an I2C bus. This eliminates the need to worry about
locking at the bus driver level. If a platform involves multiple I2C
buses then each one will have its own lock.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Generate a start condition, send the address and direction bit, and
wait for an acknowledgement from the addressed device.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Either transmit data to or receive data from the addressed device.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The previous two steps may be repeated several times, allowing data to
move in both directions during a single transfer.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Generate a stop condition, ending the current data transfer. It is
now possible to start another data transfer while the bus is still
locked, if desired.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>End the transaction by unlocking the bus, allowing other threads to
access other devices on the bus.
      </P
></LI
></OL
><P
>The simple functions <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_tx</CODE
> and
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_rx</CODE
> perform all these steps in a single
call, making them suitable for many I/O operations. The alternative
transaction-oriented functions provide greater control when
appropriate, for example if a repeated start is necessary for a
bi-directional data transfer.
    </P
><P
>With the exception of
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_begin_nb</CODE
> all the functions
will block until completion. The tx routines will return 0 if the
specified device does not respond to its address, or the number of
bytes actually transferred. This may be less than the number requested
if the device sends an early nack, for example because it has run out
of buffer space. The rx routines will return 0 or the number of bytes
received. Usually this will be the same as the
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>count</CODE
> parameter. A slave device has no way of
indicating to the master that no more data is available, so the rx
operation cannot complete early.
    </P
><P
>I2C operations should always be performed at thread-level or during
system initialization, and not inside an ISR or DSR. This greatly
simplifies locking. Also a typical ISR or DSR should not perform a
blocking operation such as an I2C transfer.

><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

can be used for simple data transfers. They both go through the
following steps: lock the bus, generate the start condition, send the
device address and the direction bit, either send or receive the data,
generate the stop condition, and unlock the bus. At the end of a
transfer the bus is back in its idle state, ready for the next
transfer.

>Transactions</H2
><P
>To allow multiple threads to access devices on the I2C some locking is
required. This is encapsulated inside transactions. The
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_tx</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_rx</CODE
>
functions implicitly use such transactions, but the functionality is
also available directly to application code. Amongst other things
transactions can be used for more complicated interactions with I2C
devices, in particular ones involving repeated starts.
    </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_begin</CODE
> must be used at the
start of a transaction. This performs thread-level locking on the bus,
blocking if it is currently in use by another thread.
    </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_begin_nb</CODE
> is a non-blocking
variant, useful for threads which cannot afford to block for an
indefinite period. If the bus is currently locked the function returns
false immediately. If the bus is not locked then it acts as
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_begin</TT
> and returns true.
    </P
><P
>Once the bus has been locked it is possible to perform one or more
data transfers by calling
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_tx</CODE
>,
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_rx</CODE
> and
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_stop</CODE
>. Code should ensure that
a stop condition has been generated by the end of a transaction.
    </P
><P
>Once the transaction is complete
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_i2c_transaction_end</CODE
> should be called. This
unlocks the bus, allowing other threads to perform I2C I/O to devices
on the same bus.
    </P
><P
>As an example consider reading the registers in an FS6377 programmable
clock generator. The first step is to write a byte 0 to the device,
setting the current register to 0. Then a repeated start condition
should be generated and it is possible to read the 16 byte-wide
registers, starting with the current one. Typical code for this might
look like:

>hal_alaia_i2c_fs6377</CODE

<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_i2c_device</CODE
> structure provided by the
platform HAL. A transaction is begun, locking the bus. Then there is a
transmit for a single byte. This transmit involves generating a start
condition and sending the address and direction bit, but not a stop
condition. Next there is a receive for 16 bytes. This also involves a
start condition, which the device will interpret as a repeated start
because it has not yet seen a stop. The start condition will be
followed by the address and direction bit, and then the device will
start transmitting the register contents. Once all 16 bytes have been
received the rx routine will send a nack rather than an ack, halting
the transfer, and then a stop condition is generated. Finally the
transaction is ended, unlocking the bus.
