><P
>Adding SPI support to an eCos port can take two forms. If there is
already an SPI bus driver for the target hardware then both that
driver and this generic SPI package <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_IO_SPI</CODE
>
should be included in the <SPAN
CLASS="DATABASE"
>ecos.db</SPAN
> target entry.
Typically the platform HAL will need to supply some platform-specific
information needed by the bus driver. In addition the platform HAL
should provide <CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_spi_device</CODE
> structures for
every device attached to the bus. The exact details of this depend on
the bus driver so its documentation should be consulted for further
details. If there is no suitable SPI bus driver yet then a new driver
package will have to be written.

>Adding a Device</H2
><P
>The generic SPI package <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_IO_SPI</CODE
> defines a
data structure <CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_spi_device</CODE
>. This contains
the information needed by the generic package, but not the additional
information needed by a bus driver to interact with the device. Each
bus driver will define a larger data structure, for example
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_mcf52xx_qspi_device</CODE
>, which contains a
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_spi_device</CODE
> as its first field. This is
analogous to C++ base and derived classes, but without any use of
virtual functions. The bus driver package should be consulted for the
details.
    </P
><P
>During initialization an SPI bus driver may need to know about all the
devices attached to that bus. For example it may need to know which
cpu pins should be configured as chip selects rather than GPIO pins.
To achieve this all device definitions should specify the particular
bus to which they are attached, for example:

>Optionally, instantiate the bus structure. The instance should have a
well-known name since it needs to be referenced by the device
structure initializers. For some drivers it may be best to create the
bus inside the driver package. For other drivers it may be better to
leave this to the platform HAL or the application. It depends on how
much platform-specific knowledge is needed to fill in the bus
structure.
