>Description</H2
><P
>The Freescale ColdFire family is a range of processors including the
MCF5206 and the MCF5282. From a programmer's perspective these
processors all share basically the same processor core, albeit with
minor differences in the instruction set. They differ in areas like
performance, on-chip peripherals and caches. Even when it comes to
peripherals there is a lot of commonality. For example many but not
all Coldfire processors use the same basic interrupt controller(s) as
the MCF5282. Similarly the on-chip UARTs tend to use the same basic
design although there are variations in the number of UARTs, the fifo
sizes, and in certain details.
    </P
><P
>    The MCFxxxx variant HAL package
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx</CODE
> provides support for
various features that are common to many but not all Coldfire
processors. This includes HAL diagnostics via an on-chip UART and
interrupt controller management for those processors which have
MCF5282-compatible controllers. The variant HAL complements the M68K
architectural HAL package. An eCos configuration should also include a
processor-specific HAL package such as
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_HAL_M68K_MCF5272</CODE
> to support the
chip-specific peripherals and cache details, and a platform HAL
package such as <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_HAL_M68K_M5272C3</CODE
> to support
board-level details like external memory chips. The processor or
platform HAL can override the functionality provided by the variant
HAL.

CLASS="REFSECT1"

>Configuration</H2
><P
>The MCFxxxx variant HAL package should be loaded automatically when
eCos is configured for appropriate target hardware. It should never be
necessary to load this package explicitly. Unloading the package
should only happen as a side effect of switching target hardware.
    </P
><P
>On most ColdFire platforms the variant HAL will provide the HAL
diagnostics support via one of the UARTs. Some platforms may provide
their own HAL diagnostics facility, for example output via an LCD. The
variant HAL diagnostics support is active if the processor or platform
implements the
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGINT_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_DIAGNOSTICS_USE_DEFAULT</CODE
>
interface. It is also active only in configurations which do not rely
on an underlying rom monitor such as RedBoot:
if <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR</CODE
> is enabled then the
default diagnostics channel will automatically be inherited from
RedBoot. The variant HAL then provides a number of configuration
options related to diagnostics:

><P
>This selects the destination for HAL diagnostics. The number of UARTs
available depends on the processor, and on any given board some of the
UARTs may not be connected. Hence the variant HAL looks for
configuration options
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART0</CODE
>, 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART1</CODE
> and
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGHWR_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_UART2</CODE
> to see which on-chip
UARTs are actually available on the processor and target hardware, and
uses this information to let the user select a UART.
        </P
><P
>When a UART is in use as the HAL diagnostics channel, that UART
should not be used for any other purpose. In particular application
code should avoid using it for I/O via the serial driver.

><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_DIAGNOSTICS_BAUD</CODE

><DD
><P
>When a UART is selected for HAL diagnostics this option specifies the
default baud rate. The most common setting is 38400. That provides a
compromise between performance and reliability, especially in
electrically noisy environments such as an industrial environment or a
test farm. Some platforms may define
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_DIAGNOSTICS_DEFAULT_BAUD</CODE
>
to handle scenarios where another default baud rate is preferable,
typically for compatibility with existing software.

></DD
><DT
><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_HAL_M68K_MCFxxxx_DIAGNOSTICS_ISRPRI</CODE
></DT
><DD
><P
>Usually the HAL diagnostics channel is driven in polled mode but in
some scenarios interrupts are required. For example, when debugging an
application over a serial line on top of the gdb stubs provided by
RedBoot, the user should be able to interrupt the application with a
control-C. The application will not be polling the HAL diagnostics
UART at this point so instead the eCos interrupt management code
interacts with the gdb stubs to do the right thing. This configuration
option selects the interrupt priority. It should be noted that on some
processors with MCF5282-compatible interrupt controllers all
priorities for enabled interrupts should be unique, and it is the
responsibility of application developers to ensure this condition is
satisfied.

Sometimes the processor HAL will then go on to undefine or redefine
some of the symbols, to reflect incompatibilities between the
processor's devices and the equivalent devices on the MCF5282. There
may also be additional symbols for the devices, and there will be
additional definitions for any processor-specific hardware. In
particular GPIO pin handling is handled by the processor HAL, not by
the variant HAL. Application developers should examine <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>proc_io.h</TT
> as well as
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>var_io.h</TT
> and the
processor-specific documentation to see exactly what I/O definitions
are provided. When porting to a new Coldfire processor it is best to
start with an existing processor HAL and copy
code as appropriate. A search for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_HAS_</TT
> in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>var_io.h</TT

informative.

interrupt controllers the priority level corresponds to
the <TT

processor. Interrupt priorities corresponding to IPL level 7 are
non-maskable. Such interrupts cannot be managed safely by the usual
eCos ISR and DSR mechanisms. Instead application code will have to
install a custom VSR and manage the entire interrupt.
      </P
><P
>Some MCF5282-compatible interrupt controllers have a major
restriction: all interrupt priorities within each controller must be
unique. If two interrupts go off at the same time and have exactly the
same priority then the controllers' behaviour is undefined. In a
typical application some of the interrupts will be handled by eCos
device drivers while others will be handled directly by application
code. Since eCos cannot know which interrupts may get used, it cannot
allocate unique priorities. Instead this has to be left to the
application developer. eCos does provide configuration options such as
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK_ISR_PRIORITY</CODE
> and
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_DEVS_SERIAL_MCFxxxx_SERIAL0_ISR_PRIORITY</CODE

provide control over the eCos-managed interrupts, and provides default
values for these which are unique.

>Non-unique interrupt priorities can lead to very confusing system
behaviour. For example on an MCF5282, if the PIT3 system clock
(interrupt 0x3a) and ethernet RX frame (interrupt 0x1b) are
accidentally given the same priority and go off at the same time, the
interrupt controller may actually issue an interrupt 0x3b, the bitwise
or of the two interrupt numbers. That interrupt belongs to the on-chip
flash module. There may not be an installed handler for that interrupt
at all, and even if there is a handler it will only manipulate the
flash hardware and not clear the system clock and ethernet interrupts.
Hence the system is likely to go into a spin, continually trying to
service the wrong interrupt. To track down such problems during
debugging it may prove useful to install a breakpoint on the
