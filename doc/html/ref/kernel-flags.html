>Event flags allow a consumer thread to wait for one of several
different types of event to occur. Alternatively it is possible to
wait for some combination of events. The implementation is relatively
straightforward. Each event flag contains a 32-bit integer.
Application code associates these bits with specific events, so for
example bit 0 could indicate that an I/O operation has completed and
data is available, while bit 1 could indicate that the user has
pressed a start button. A producer thread or a DSR can cause one or
more of the bits to be set, and a consumer thread currently waiting
for these bits will be woken up.
      </P
><P
>Unlike semaphores no attempt is made to keep track of event counts. It
does not matter whether a given event occurs once or multiple times
before being consumed, the corresponding bit in the event flag will
change only once. However semaphores cannot easily be used to handle
multiple event sources. Event flags can often be used as an
alternative to condition variables, although they cannot be used for
completely arbitrary conditions and they only support the equivalent
of condition variable broadcasts, not signals.
      </P
><P
>Before an event flag can be used it must be initialized by a call to
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_init</CODE
>. This takes a pointer to a
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_flag_t</CODE
> data structure, which can be part of a
larger structure. All 32 bits in the event flag will be set to 0,
indicating that no events have yet occurred. If an event flag is no
longer required it can be cleaned up with a call to
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_destroy</CODE
>, allowing the memory for the
<CODE
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>cyg_flag_t</CODE
> structure to be re-used.
      </P
><P
>A consumer thread can wait for one or more events by calling
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_wait</CODE
>. This takes three arguments. The
first identifies a particular event flag. The second is some
combination of bits, indicating which events are of interest. The
final argument should be one of the following:

be available. Instead each disjoint set of events requires its own
event flag.

>A call to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

required condition is satisfied. It will return the value of the event
flag at the point that the operation succeeded, which may be a
superset of the requested events. If
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

that is currently in a wait operation, the
<CODE

><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_timed_wait</CODE
> is a variant of
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_wait</CODE
> which adds a timeout: the wait
operation must succeed within the specified number of ticks, or it
will fail with a return value of 0. The number of ticks is specified
as an absolute, not relative tick count, and so in order to wait for a
relative number of ticks, the return value of the
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_current_time()</CODE
> function should be added to
determine the absolute number of ticks.
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_poll</CODE
> is a non-blocking variant: if the
wait operation can succeed immediately it acts like
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_wait</CODE
>, otherwise it returns immediately
with a value of 0.
      </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_setbits</CODE
> is called by a producer thread
or from inside a DSR when an event occurs. The specified bits are or'd
into the current event flag value. This may cause one or more waiting 
threads to be woken up, if their conditions are now satisfied. How many 
threads are awoken depends on the use of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR</TT
>. The queue of threads waiting on the flag is walked to find 
threads which now have their wake condition fulfilled. If the awoken thread 
has passed <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR</TT
> the walking of the queue 
is terminated, otherwise the walk continues. Thus if no threads have passed 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMORE_CLR</TT
> all threads with fulfilled 
conditions will be awoken. If <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR</TT
> is 
passed by threads with fulfilled conditions, the number of awoken threads 
will depend on the order the threads are in the queue.
      </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_maskbits</CODE
> can be used to clear one or
more bits in the event flag. This can be called from a producer when a
particular condition is no longer satisfied, for example when the user
is no longer pressing a particular button. It can also be used by a
consumer thread if <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR</TT
> was not
used as part of the wait operation, to indicate that some but not all
of the active events have been consumed. If there are multiple
consumer threads performing wait operations without using
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR</CODE
> then typically some
additional synchronization such as a mutex is needed to prevent
multiple threads consuming the same event.
      </P
><P
>Two additional functions are provided to query the current state of an
event flag. <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_peek</CODE
> returns the current
value of the event flag, and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_waiting</CODE
> can
be used to find out whether or not there are any threads currently
blocked on the event flag. Both of these functions must be used with
care because other threads may be operating on the event flag.
