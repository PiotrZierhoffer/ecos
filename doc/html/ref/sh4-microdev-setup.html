>In a typical development environment, the MicroDev board boots from
flash into the RedBoot ROM monitor. eCos applications are configured
for RAM startup and then downloaded and run on the board via the
debugger sh-elf-gdb. Preparing the board therefore usually involves
programming a suitable RedBoot image into flash memory. Alternatively
RedBoot may be programmed into a PLCC EEPROM and inserted into socket U21,
although in that case, the flash memory is not accessible.

>Programming the RedBoot ROM monitor into flash memory requires an
application that can manage flash blocks. RedBoot itself has this
capability. Rather than have a separate application that is used only
for flash management during the initial installation, a special
RAM-resident version of RedBoot is loaded into memory and run. This
version can then be used to load the normal flash-resident version of
RedBoot and program it into the flash.
    </P

>The first step is to connect an RS232 null modem cable between the MicroDev
serial port and the host PC. Next start a terminal emulation application such as
HyperTerminal or minicom on the host PC and set the serial
communication parameters to 38400 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop
bit (8N1) and no flow control (handshaking).
