>There are a number of reasons why the output will not be 100%
accurate. Collecting the flat profile typically involves timer
interrupts so any code that runs with interrupts disabled will not
appear. The current host-side gprof implementation maps program
counter values onto symbols using a bin mechanism. When a bin spans
the end of one function and the start of the next gprof may report the
wrong function. This is especially likely on architectures with
single-byte instructions such as an x86. When examining gprof output
it may prove useful to look at a linker map or program disassembly.

counter is needed for every 16 bytes of code. For an application with
say 512K of code that means dynamically allocating a 64K array. If the
target hardware is low on memory then this may be unacceptable, and
the requirements can be reduced by increasing the bucket size. However
this will affect the accuracy of the results and gprof is more likely
to report the wrong function. It also increases the risk of a counter
overflow.

The HAL package may modify this interval because of hardware
restrictions, and the generated profile data will contain the actual
interval that was used. Usually it is a good idea to use an interval
that is not a simple fraction of the system clock, typically 10000
microseconds. Otherwise there is a risk that the profiling timer will
disproportionally sample code that runs only in response to the system

provides two ways of extracting data: a gdb macro or tftp transfers.
Using tftp is faster but requires a TCP/IP stack on the target. It
also consumes some additional target-side resources, including an
extra tftp daemon thread and its stack. The gdb macro can be used even
when the eCos configuration does not include a TCP/IP stack. However
it is much slower, typically taking tens of seconds to retrieve all
the data for a non-trivial application.

current directory, and then reset all counts. gprof uses only a 16 bit
counter for every bucket of code. These counters can easily saturate
if the profiling run goes on for a long time, or if the application
code spends nearly all its time in just a few tight inner loops. The
counters will not actually wrap around back to zero, instead they will
stick at 0xFFFF, but this will still affect the accuracy of the gprof
output. Hence it is desirable to reset the counters once the profiling

>Support for collecting the call graph data via
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>mcount</CODE
> is optional and can be controlled via
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_PROFILE_CALLGRAPH</CODE
>. This option will only be
active if the HAL provides the underlying <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>mcount</CODE
>
support and implements <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGINT_PROFILE_HAL_MCOUNT</CODE
>.
The call graph data allows gprof to produce more useful output, but at
the cost of extra run-time and memory overheads. If this option is
disabled then the <CODE
CLASS="OPTION"
>-pg</CODE
> compiler flag should not be used.
    </P
><P
>If <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_PROFILE_CALLGRAPH</CODE
> is enabled then there
are two further options which can be used to control memory
requirements. Collecting the data requires two blocks of memory, a
simple hash table and an array of arc records. The
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>mcount</CODE
> code uses the program counter address to
index into the hash table, giving the first element of a singly linked
list. The array of arc records contains the various linked lists for
each hash slot. The required number of arc records depends on the
number of function calls in the application. For example if a function
<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>Proc_7</CODE
> is called from three different places in
the application then three arc records will be needed.
    </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_PROFILE_CALLGRAPH_HASH_SHIFT</CODE
> controls the
size of the hash table. The default value of 8 means that the program
counter is shifted right by eight places to give a hash table index.
Hence each hash table slot corresponds to 256 bytes of code, and for
an application with say 512K of code <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>profile_on</TT
>
will dynamically allocate an 8K hash table. Increasing the shift size
reduces the memory requirement, but means that each hash table slot
will correspond to more code and hence <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>mcount</CODE
>
will need to traverse a longer linked list of arc records.
    </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_PROFILE_CALLGRAPH_ARC_PERCENTAGE</CODE
> controls
how much memory <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>profile_on</CODE
> will allocate for the
arc records. This uses a simple heuristic, a percentage of the overall
code size. By default the amount of arc record space allocated will be
5% of the code size, so for a 512K executable that requires
approximately 26K. This default should suffice for most applications.
In exceptional cases it may be insufficient and a diagnostic will be
generated when the profiling data is extracted.

Typically it will be implemented by the variant or platform HAL

automatically allocating a per-function word of memory to eliminate
